This is the Final Project for Adam Abbas and Inbar Pe'er, Period 10. Our goal was to create a platform where a user can play both the original, and several different variations on the popular game Tic Tac Toe! Here's what we've done:

<ul>

<li> Our Main GUI </li>
<p style="color:blue;"> Our GUI is built on a 2x4 Grid Layout. The first row containes buttons that open the 4 different TicTacToe games. The second row is comprised of JLabels, which display the score (X vs O). Keep in mind that this is a two player game! </p>
